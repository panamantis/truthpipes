TruthPipes project for ethereum waterloo2

The golden age of the Internet is over. Its' "pipes" are full of AI spam, unpoliced political ads and shotty big-tech policies. It's time to take back control of your browser experience. Yes, it's time to censor YOUR Internet.

Check-in to the Internet with a custom profile and leverage pre-built rules that support the Free World, Climate Change, truthful political ads, etc.

The Blockchain to Browser technology injects CSS into the webpages you browse.  You can suggest or create rules by leaving details on [www.truthpipes.com](http://www.truthpipes.com).  For example, the harmful Amazon product B004H89KFC can be entered and it will immediately be flagged on amazon.com.

# Python Developers!
Check out /pygas/ for an encapsulation of web3.py for standard gas-function runs.  It's still in development, but I plan to release the cleaned module in the future!

# Installation
You can install the pre-compiled chromium extension via eth_extension/compiled_chromium_extension.
